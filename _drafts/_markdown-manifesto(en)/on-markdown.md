Writing, storing, and retrieving documents are central to the workflow of knowledge production.

There is a way to remove the overhead of proprietary software and processes to distill the workflow to its essence: Writing *plain text*. Text that works anywhere, anytime, to convey what you mean. The most popular solution to writing plain text that can transform into whatever you need it to be is called Markdown.

Markdown is not another software or file format. Markdown is merely a convention, written in *plain text*. This format has been around since the electronic typewriter and powers all the technologies we have come to rely on: Code is also written in plain text.

To have plain text convey meta information like: "this is a headline" or "this is an item in a checklist" we need conventions to efficiently communicate the added meaning. Conventions that are easy to read and don't distract from the flow of the text. Conventions that are also being unambiguous so that machines can translate and transform them, just like code. Markdown introduces such conventions, inspired by the formatting conventions of old emails from before the time of fancy styling.

Doing so, Markdown separates content from its form. How big should a headline be? Don't worry about it when you are writing. You can apply different styling instructions about how you want your meta information to be translated into form after the fact. Or have a computer do it for you. You can even convert your text into different formats after the fact, like producing Microsoft Word documents or PDFs from your writing.

With Markdown you apply semantic structure to your text (a title, paragraph, sections, subsections, footnotes, etc.) and mark them with some unobtrusive characters. The computer "compiles" the resulting text with a typesetting interpreter. It will format the document consistently, according to a specified style.

Markdown conventions come in different dialects or flavors, light variations on advanced semantic structures that are designed for use in particular contexts, such as blogs, wikis, or code repositories. We have created an interpreter that allows you to keep using most of all the existing conventions and is very forgiving in what kinds of structures it interprets. So you can copy and paste text from other software and formats as hassle free as possible. We have also introduced a few new conventions that make structuring presentations and visualizations easier for you.
